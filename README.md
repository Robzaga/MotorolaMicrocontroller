# MotorolaMicrocontroller

This program was assigned to me Spring 2017. It is programmed to bring in data from senosr that senses distance. The program displays onto an LCD screen in Hex values. There are three sensors total so the output reads as follows:     
        L:XX C:XX R:XX     
The purpose of this assignment was to work with the Analog-to-Digital Converter and how the data is stored in memory.
